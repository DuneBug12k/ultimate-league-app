Ann Arbor Ultimate, also known as Ann Arbor Ultimate Summer League, started in the summer of 1994. The first summer league featured a handful of teams playing all games on the one field at Lakewood Elementary School.<br /><br />Since those humble beginnings, Ann Arbor Ultimate has grown steadily, adding more players and teams. The 2008 Summer League featured close to 700 players, many of whom play on more than 1 team, and 36 teams in all. In summer league games, the highest priorities are spirited play and participation by all. Teams work hard to help new players learn the game, try and perfect new skills, catch the disk, and score. On field disputes are resolved through the cooperation of the players on the field. Teams honor the opposing team with cheers, and often opposing teams share a table at a local restaurant after the game.<br /><br />Ann Arbor Ultimate is run by a loose knit organizing committee known as the Junta. Since the organization is run entirely by volunteers, it''s important that there are new volunteers every year, to spread out the work of putting together leagues and tournaments. If you have some ideas about how we could make our programs even more fun, or just want to volunteer to help out, please contact The Junta and check out our <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/juntaannarborultimate/Home" target="_blank">volunteer site</a>. We''ll try to recruit you to come and join the Junta. Please note that the minimum requirement for an official Junta meeting is that at least two ultimate players must be present and at least one beer must be consumed. If you are interested in volunteering, please contact: <a href="mailto:info@a2ultimate.org" target="_blank">info@a2ultimate.org</a> . <br /><br />To find more information about our leagues, please visit our <a href="/a2ultimate/welcome" target="_blank">welcome page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For other issues, <a href="/a2ultimate/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a></p>\r\n<p>Last updated: 1/2/2009</p>',`nav_bar_id` = NULL WHERE `static_content`.`id` = 2;

The group has been meeting for over 15 years and has a good core of players that builds each year. There are stalls and organized offense and defense depending on the player mix that day. The basic premise is fun and outdoor enjoyment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tips for Playing in your first Ultimate Pickup Game</p>\r\n<ol class="text_information">\r\n<li>Introduce                  yourself. Ask if this game uses a stall count and if there are any special                  rules.</li>\r\n<li>Bring                  a white shirt AND a dark shirt. This makes it easier to form teams. Don''t                  bring gray or yellow, they are always confusing.</li>\r\n<li>Some                  pickup games use the <strong>Last Back</strong> system for substituting when there                  are a lot of subs trying to get into the game. When Last Back is used, it                  means that each time one team scores, it''s an open call for players on the                  other team. So if white scores and you want to get into the game on the                  dark team, just run to the line where the dark team will start the point,                  with your dark shirt. The first seven players to the line are the dark                  team for the next point.</li>\r\n<li>If                  something happens on the field that you don''t understand, ask a more                  experienced player.</li>\r\n<li>Most                  of the time, when the other team is on offense you will be playing person                  to person defense, where each player on the defensive team guards one                  player on the other team. It''s important that two teammates not guard the                  same opponent, since that will leave another opponent unguarded. When one                  team is about to Pull (throw the disk down the field to start the point), the pulling team                  matches up against the receiving team. The most common way to do this is by                  matching up across, i.e. the players on the pulling team matching the                  players on the receiving team in the order they are standing on the line.                  If you find yourself matched against a super ultimate stud (or anyone you''d                  prefer not to mark) ask someone on your team to switch. Don''t just decide                  on your own to switch, since this will leave your team not marking the                  person you switched off of.</li>\r\n<li>When                  your team turns the disc over (either throws it incomplete or throws it                  out of bounds or it''s caught by the other team) you will switch from                  offense to defense. Normally you will mark the person who was marking you.                  If it''s confusing or people don''t know who to mark, pick an opponent and tell                  your teammates "I''ve got the guy in the orange and purple shirt" so they''ll                  know that that''s who you are marking and they need to mark someone else. </li>\r\n<li> Don''t forget: it''s for fun. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Last updated: 1/2/2009</p>',`nav_bar_id` = NULL WHERE `static_content`.`id` = 4;
